### About Us

Ager (Latin for field) is a web solution for agriculture SMEs to transition to net zero carbon emissions.
Ager allows SMEs to gain advice on how to launch a new green business or how to change their existing business to a green business.
Ager also enables SMEs to see government incentives and funding to help achieve net zero as outlined by COP26. Additionally, ager provides a curated list of trusted
suppliers with massive rewards and savings when purchasing supplies for your agricultural needs.
Finally, there is a login option to create an account enabling you to connect with lenders, farmers and land owners who are working to achieve net zero.
